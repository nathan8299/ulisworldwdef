Ulis World 1.8.1 You actually do read this file, don'cha?WHAT IS THIS JUNK? Ulis World is a replacement for the System WDEF. It was originally created to serve as an example how to write a WDEF. It quickly evolved into my way of customizing the Mac. I created it the way I'd like to have my System's WDEF (and I also use it myself).It is very similar to the grand of "Copland"-WDEFs floating around in the networks except that it features close, grow and zoom boxes like the standard System WDEF. Contrary to other Coplands (I don't want to mention names...) whose grow box is a part of their frame, this one only draws the grow box when the application tells it to. Thus, the Finder's info boxes don't have useless grow boxes.DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! I encourage everybody to use this WDEF, and I'd like to hear your suggestions as to what you'd like to see changed in any way. I like to hear from folks using my stuff, and I also appreciate any suggestions that improve it.No need to read the DISCLAIMER: <g>Ulis World is © Copyright 1996 by Uli Kusterer, all rights reserved.
