Ulis World 2.01 You actually do read this file, don'cha?WHAT IS THIS JUNK? Ulis World is a replacement for the System WDEF. It replaces the window frames with a nice look. It was originally created to serve as an example how to write a WDEF. It quickly evolved into my way of customizing the Mac. I created it the way I wanted to have my System's WDEF (and I also use it myself).It provides various options to customize compilation: You can make it compile in a bright and a dark version (dark is default), and you can also specify whether disabled windows should be dark/light independently of the setting for active windows. Also, you can make it use a custom font for the window titles or compile it with floating window-like dots instead of stripes. Last but not least, it uses 'cicn' resources for all gadgets and the grow box, which enables you to use ResEdit to customize them.TROUBLE SHOOTING:If you encounter strange behaviour while using Ulis World, e.g. Error -108, crashes after opening four windows, out-of-memory messages while large amounts of memory are still available, you may want to try increasing the Finder's memory partition. You can do this either by temporarily changing the Finder's file type to 'APPL' and setting the preferred memory to a larger amount (about 400k should suffice), or by editing its 'SIZE' resources using a resource editor. This may also apply to other WDEFs installed as System replacements using Façade, Aaron, Church Windows or something similar. This especially applies to 68k WDEFs running under PPC system software.DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! I encourage everybody to use this WDEF, and I'd like to hear your suggestions as to what you'd like to see changed in any way. I like to hear from folks using my stuff, and I also appreciate any suggestions that improve it.No need to read the DISCLAIMER: <g>Ulis World is © Copyright 1996 by Uli Kusterer, all rights reserved.
